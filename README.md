Docker-Pi
=========

Docker Pi = docker + Raspberry Pi 
"Docker Pi" is a system that is docker in combination with a Raspberry Pi.

## description
Building a docker system using the raspberry pi, I expressed the "real container".
Usage is very simple. The button on the Docker Pi when you press and hold the specified container starts. Thatâ€™s all.
This allows you to intuitively express the concept docker. And, people around you will keep you interested in the docker.
